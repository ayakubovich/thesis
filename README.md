This is a home to the manuscript of my Master's thesis, which I defended at York Univerity on October 2014. 

#Abstract
This thesis addresses the problem of shape representation using the GRID/formlet theory, a system based on localized diffeomorphisms. While this framework enjoys many desirable properties, it suffers from several limitations: it converges slowly for shapes with elongated parts, and it can be sensitive to parameterization as well as grossly ill-conditioned. Several innovations are proposed to address these problems: 1) The formlet basis is generalized to include oriented deformation, improving convergence for elongated parts. 2) A recent contour remapping method is applied in order to eliminate problems due to drift of the model parameterization during matching pursuit. 3) A regularizing term is introduced in order to limit redundancy in formlet parameters and improve the modelâ€™s identifiability. Finally, an algorithm is proposed to hierarchically cluster formlets, and is shown to induce a partial ordering on the representation.
